# Snake Game
Creating a snake game using PlatformIO and Wokwi simulation. This project is an advanced version of the classic Snake game designed for Arduino using the Adafruit ILI9341 TFT display. It features multiple gameplay levels with increasing complexity:

Level 1: Basic snake and red food

Level 2: Introduces barrier obstacles

Level 3: Time-limited food with countdown timer

Level 4: Red (point-increasing) and blue (point-decreasing) foods with strategic avoidance

Joystick control is used for snake movement, and the game includes screen wrapping, dynamic difficulty, and high score tracking.
